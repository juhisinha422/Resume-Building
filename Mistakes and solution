Your resume has 6 seconds to make or break your first impression.

Read that again.

6 seconds. That’s all you get.

But what if you could build a job-winning resume in one shot?

Here’s how I optimized my resume using facts, frameworks, and feedback

3 Hard Truths about Your Resume:

==> ATS (Applicant Tracking System) reads before a recruiter does
==> 6–8 seconds – That’s all a recruiter spends scanning it
==> 1 Page for Freshers (0–1 Yrs) | 1–2 Pages for Experienced (3+ Yrs)

Common Resume Mistakes (That I Was Guilty Of):

-- Overusing LinkedIn Easy Apply without customizing
-- Repeating the same words throughout
-- Using AI tools blindly for job descriptions
-- Not using numbers, impact, or metrics

Use STAR Format to write real experience:

S - Situation 
T - Tasks
A - Action
R - Results

My Resume Optimization Score:

- Resume Worded: 72 / 100
- JobScan: 64% match

How to Build a Winning Resume:

=====> For Freshers (0–1 Yrs) <=====

>>> 1 Page only

>>> Focus on projects & outcomes

=====> For Experienced (2–6 Yrs) <=====
