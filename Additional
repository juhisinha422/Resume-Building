𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐝𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞?
I started messaging HRs directly on LinkedIn with a short intro + resume.
I tailored my resume for every job role — used the keywords from their JD.
I applied to 15–20 jobs every single day — no excuses.
And slowly, the calls started coming.

And slowly, the calls started rolling in.

But here’s the part no one talks about:
Getting calls is just half the battle.
You also need to perform well in interviews.

That’s where most candidates get stuck.
Random Leetcode questions won’t help you without strategy.
So I shifted my focus:
🔹 DSA Patterns Cheat Sheet - https://lnkd.in/dYEZwECp
🔹 Real-world projects - https://lnkd.in/dcDV6bXS
🔹 and tailor or resume - https://lnkd.in/dzHnwEuw

And if you're also stuck in that loop —
applying everywhere but nothing clicks...

I’ve compiled everything that helped me into a guide that’s made for YOU:
